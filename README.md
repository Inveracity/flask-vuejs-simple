# flask-vuejs-simple
A very basic flask app with a vue-cli generated frontend

### clone
```
λ git clone https://github.com/inveracity/flask-vuejs-simple
λ cd flask-vuejs-simple
```

### Install dependencies
```
λ npm install
```

### Build
```
λ npm run build
```

### Run backend flask app in a separate terminal
```
λ python run.py
```

### Run frontend for handy autorefresh
```
λ npm run dev
```

# Things to note

Look at the config/index.js file, it does a proxy thing so that it's easier to make api requests to the flask app when running in dev mode.
